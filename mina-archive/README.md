# `mina-archive` helm chart

A helm chart to deploy Mina protocol archive node and Postgres database subchart.

NOTE: Currently MF does not have chart repository. To install this chart i.e. with helmfile you need to reffer to it following ways:
 ```console
 # helmfile.yaml
 <..>
 releases:
   - name: mina-archive
     chart: git::ssh://git@github.com/MinaProtocol/mina-helm-charts-private.git@mina-archive?ref=main
 <..>
 ```

## Subcharts

`mina-archive` uses only one subchart:
 - `postgresql` from https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

NOTE: `mina-archive` is filled by the mina daemon connecting to it. However charts were created separately for wider usability. These dependencies can/should be glued outside of chart using tools like `helmfile`.

    Optional: helmfile to install this chart

## Installation

To install this Helm chart, the easiest is to create a helmfile.yaml with needed values and run:
    ```bash

    $ helmfile apply
    ```

You can get some inspiration from helmfiles in `examples` folder.

Verify that the chart is deployed successfully:

    ```bash
    helmfile status #although kubectl probably would give better insights.
    ```
